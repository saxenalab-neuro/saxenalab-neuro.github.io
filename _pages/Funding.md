# Open positions

**We are currently open to Postdoc and PhD applications.**

We are looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:shreya.saxena@yale.edu). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. 

We especially welcome PhDs and Postdocs with fellowships. Take a look at the [Wu Tsai postdoctoral fellowship](https://wti.yale.edu/initiatives/postdoctoral), [Wu Tsai graduate fellowship](https://wti.yale.edu/initiatives/graduate). In many countries, there are also fellowships available for outstanding postdocs.**
