We are a dynamic research group at the [Wu Tsai Institute at Yale University](https://wti.yale.edu/). Our aim is to explore and understand the brain using computational methods.

We were recently funded by the [NIH](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Wp0Hllx7EUqulszRPgfUQQ/project-details/10488409) and the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2219876&HistoricalAwards=false). We are actively recruiting graduate students and postdocs. Please reach out to Prof. Saxena for details.
