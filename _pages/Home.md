We are a dynamic research group at the [Wu Tsai Institute at Yale University](https://wti.yale.edu/). We develop biologically inspired goal- and data- driven artificial intelligence methods to elucidate the neurodynamical basis of behavior, ranging from sensorimotor control to social behavior. Our aim is to better understand the brain using computational methods.

We were recently funded by the [NIH](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Wp0Hllx7EUqulszRPgfUQQ/project-details/10488409) and the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2219876&HistoricalAwards=false). We are actively recruiting graduate students and postdocs. Please reach out to Prof. Saxena for details.

## Lab Statement
We strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all members of the lab to learn from each other and work as a team. We believe that we benefit most from the exploration of a diverse set of ideas. We acknowledge, welcome, and celebrate our differences, including those related to race, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, disability status, and socioeconomic status.  We work to prevent implicit biases from negatively impacting our lab and the community around us.
