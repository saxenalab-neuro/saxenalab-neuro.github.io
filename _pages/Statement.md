# Lab Statement
We strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all members of the lab to learn from each other and work as a team. We believe that we benefit most from the exploration of a diverse set of ideas. We acknowledge, welcome, and celebrate our differences, including those related to race, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, disability status, and socioeconomic status.  We work to prevent implicit biases from negatively impacting our lab and the community around us.
