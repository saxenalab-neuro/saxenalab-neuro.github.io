**DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS FOR REAL-TIME DECODING OF NEURALLY-ENCODED SIGNALS, THAT ENSURE STABILITY IN CLOSED LOOP**
Decoding the digital signal that is transmitted by the neurons in the motor cortex to the muscles benefits the design of reliable prosthetics for rapid movements in uncertain environments. To that end, we developed a non-linear decoder for the neuronal ‘intent of movement’ signal which converges to the desired movement in the presence of neuronal encoding [1]. We also derived conditions for the stability of the movement generation in the presence of feedback as a function of the bandwidth of the movement and biophysical parameters of the neurons and the muscle [2]. The research can be applied towards a Brain-Machine Interface to drive a prosthetic or a compensatory device in a closed loop system involving visual and sensory feedback.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
