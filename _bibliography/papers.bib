abstract = {Volition – the sense of control or agency over one’s voluntary actions – is widely recognized as the basis of both human subjective experience and natural behavior in nonhuman animals. Several human studies have found peaks in neural activity preceding voluntary actions, for example the readiness potential (RP), and some have shown upcoming actions could be decoded even before awareness. Others propose that random processes underlie and explain pre-movement neural activity. Here, we seek to address these issues by evaluating whether pre-movement neural activity in mice contains structure beyond that present in random neural activity. Implementing a self-initiated water-rewarded lever-pull paradigm in mice while recording widefield [Ca++] neural activity we find that cortical activity changes in variance seconds prior to movement and that upcoming lever pulls could be predicted between 3 and 5 s (or more in some cases) prior to movement. We found inhibition of motor cortex starting at approximately 5 s prior to lever pulls and activation of motor cortex starting at approximately 2 s prior to a random unrewarded left limb movement. We show that mice, like humans, are biased toward commencing self-initiated actions during specific phases of neural activity but that the pre-movement neural code changes over time in some mice and is widely distributed as behavior prediction improved when using all vs. single cortical areas. These findings support the presence of structured multi-second neural dynamics preceding self-initiated action beyond that expected from random processes. Our results also suggest that neural mechanisms underlying self-initiated action could be preserved between mice and humans.},

abstract = {Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.},

We detail four areas of the field where the joint analysis of neural populations has significantly furthered our understanding of computation in the brain: correlated variability, decoding, neural dynamics, and artificial neural networks. Together, these findings suggest an exciting trend towards a new era where neural populations are understood to be the essential unit of computation in many brain regions, a classic idea that has been given new life.},

 abstract = {Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.},

	abstract = {Effectively modeling and quantifying behavior is essential for our understanding of the brain. Modeling behavior in naturalistic settings in social and multi-subject tasks in a unified manner remains a significant challenge. Modeling the behavior of different subjects performing the same task requires partitioning the behavioral data into features that are common across subjects, and others that are distinct to each subject. Modeling social interactions between multiple individuals in a freely-moving setting requires disentangling effects due to the individual as compared to social investigations. To achieve flexible disentanglement of behavior into interpretable latent variables with individual and across-subject or social components, we build on a semi-supervised approach to partition the behavioral subspace, and propose a novel regularization based on the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to the model. Our model, known as the constrained subspace variational autoencoder (CS-VAE), successfully models distinct features of the behavioral videos across subjects, as well as continuously varying differences in social behavior. Our approach vastly facilitates the analysis of the resulting latent variables in downstream tasks such as uncovering disentangled behavioral motifs and the efficient decoding of a novel subject{\textquoteright}s behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Summary
A key aspect of neuroscience research is the development of powerful, general-purpose data analyses that process large datasets. Unfortunately, modern data analyses have a hidden dependence upon complex computing infrastructure (e.g., software and hardware), which acts as an unaddressed deterrent to analysis users. Although existing analyses are increasingly shared as open-source software, the infrastructure and knowledge needed to deploy these analyses efficiently still pose significant barriers to use. In this work, we develop Neuroscience Cloud Analysis As a Service (NeuroCAAS): a fully automated open-source analysis platform offering automatic infrastructure reproducibility for any data analysis. We show how NeuroCAAS supports the design of simpler, more powerful data analyses and that many popular data analysis tools offered through NeuroCAAS outperform counterparts on typical infrastructure. Pairing rigorous infrastructure management with cloud resources, NeuroCAAS dramatically accelerates the dissemination and use of new data analyses for neuroscientific discovery.},

    abstract = "{The ability to move fast and accurately track moving objects is fundamentally constrained by the biophysics of neurons and dynamics of the muscles involved. Yet the corresponding trade-offs between these factors and tracking motor commands have not been rigorously quantified. We use feedback control principles to quantify performance limitations of the sensorimotor control system (SCS) to track fast periodic movements. We show that (1) linear models of the SCS fail to predict known undesirable phenomena, including skipped cycles, overshoot and undershoot, produced when tracking signals in the “fast regime,” while nonlinear pulsatile control models can predict such undesirable phenomena, and (2) tools from nonlinear control theory allow us to characterize fundamental limitations in this fast regime. Using a validated and tractable nonlinear model of the SCS, we derive an analytical upper bound on frequencies that the SCS model can reliably track before producing such undesirable phenomena as a function of the neurons' biophysical constraints and muscle dynamics. The performance limitations derived here have important implications in sensorimotor control. For example, if the primary motor cortex is compromised due to disease or damage, the theory suggests ways to manipulate muscle dynamics by adding the necessary compensatory forces using an assistive neuroprosthetic device to restore motor performance and, more important, fast and agile movements. Just how one should compensate can be informed by our SCS model and the theory developed here.}",
